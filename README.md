## Hello. 
My cat's name is Daisy. 
She is not currently on fire, nor has she ever been to my knowledge.

Occasionally it is convenient to use her spontaneous combustion as an excuse to get out of things. This website is meant to be used as a quick thing to link people who have questions or are concerned about the well-being of Daisy.

Feel free to contribute... I'm okay with this becoming an abomination :)
